## Overview

**ASTEREORRY** is an interactive web-based orrery, designed to visualize and educate users on the orbits of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), with a particular focus on **Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)**. Our tool provides an engaging experience for middle and high school students, making the study of space, asteroids, and their potential impact on Earth accessible and fun.

## What Does ASTEREORRY Do?

ASTEREORRY offers a **3D, web-based interactive orrery** that models the Solar System with a focus on Near Earth Objects, especially PHAs. Users can explore the Solar System with:

- **Planetary orbits**: All planets scaled with respect to Earth and shown in astronomical units (AU).
- **Near-Earth asteroid orbits**: Using real-time data from NASA‚Äôs Small-Body Database, we display interactive asteroid orbits.
- **Zoom & Focus**: Easily zoom into planets and asteroids, gaining perspective on their relative distances and trajectories.

---

## How Does ASTEREORRY Work?

- **Scaling**: All planets are scaled with respect to the Earth, with their distances from the Sun based on AU (Astronomical Units).
- **3D Interaction**: The orbits of near-Earth asteroids are represented with clickable CAD models, and users can zoom in/out to explore asteroid paths.
- **Real-time Data**: The asteroid data is dynamically imported from NASA‚Äôs API to display accurate Near-Earth Object information.
- **User-Friendly Controls**: Designed for ease of use, with intuitive controls for younger audiences to explore space.

## Benefits of ASTEREORRY

- **Visual Learning**: This web app provides an accessible, interactive way to visualize the orbits of potentially hazardous asteroids and understand their possible impacts on Earth.
- **Engaging Interface**: The 3D models and controls make space exploration fun and informative for students.
- **Focus on Education**: Tailored to middle and high schoolers, with simplified concepts for easy understanding of complex topics like orbital mechanics and asteroid hazards.

---

## Project Goals

Our primary objective is to **educate students** about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) through an immersive, interactive experience. The tool offers a clear visualization of the dangers posed by asteroids while promoting the importance of ongoing research.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for building the user interface.
- **Three.js** for rendering 3D elements and interactive space environments.
- **TypeScript** for type-safe and maintainable code.
- **NASA's Small-Body Database API** for real-time asteroid data.

---

## Future Improvements

We plan to expand the ASTEREORRY platform to make it even more engaging and informative, including:

- **Pop-ups with Asteroid Information**: Display details about each asteroid, including when it will pass by Earth, its distance from the planet, and orbital parameters.
- **Orbital Parameters Explainer**: Provide educational pop-ups explaining orbital elements (eccentricity, semi-major axis, etc.) in simpler terms for younger audiences.
- **Interactive Games**:
  - Identify potentially hazardous asteroids based on provided parameters.
  - Simulate asteroid impact scenarios and explore redirection missions like NASA's DART.
- **Fun Facts**: Include interesting details like Earth‚Äôs "mini-moons" and other space trivia.
